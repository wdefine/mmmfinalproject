### Description
The purpose of this project is to provide an educational tool that will assist people in understanding the spread of infectious disease.  We wish to empower people with education during the uncertainty that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused worldwide.  Our intent is not to provide a model that makes predictions, but to provide a model that allows for understanding of how a serious outbreak develops in theory.  We hope that our model can help users to understand how different factors affect the spread of a contagious virus.  Among these factors are strategies for mitigating spread like social distancing and the implementation of test and trace strategies.  We hope that our model can provide users with theoretical understanding of how these strategies help to slow the spread of infectious disease.
